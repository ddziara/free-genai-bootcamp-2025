	-BAD: in the vocabulary table it did not show japanese characters, the cells are just blank
	- BAD: the beginner sentence is unnecessary, should just start showing the vocabulary table
	- BAD: In the clues we should not provide the polite form of verbs, because the student needs to figure that out
	- BAD: The sentence structure says too much we really want something that is conceptual like this: [Location][Subject][Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

Let's work through this together.
Here's a table of vocabulary that might help:
|Japanese	| Romaji	| English |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
|			| kuma	 	| bear    | 
|			| doa		| door	  |
|			| gomi		| garbage |
|			| suteru	| to throw away |
|			| dasu		| to put out    |

Possible sentence structure: (Topic)(Location)(Subject)(Verb)
For the first part of the sentence "Bears are at the door", think about how to express "bears" as the topic, "door" as the location, and "to be" as the verb.
For the second part "did you leave the garbage out?", consider how to express "garbage" as the object, "to put out" as the verb, and "you" as the subject.
What do you think is the next step? Do you want to try writing the sentence in Japanese or would you like more clues?
