The formatted output will generally contain three parts:
- vocabulary table
- sentence structure
- clues and considerations

### Vocabulary Table
- the table should only include nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives
- the table of vocabulary should only have the following columns: Japanese, Romaji, English
- Do not provide paticles in the vocabulary table, student needs to figure this out the corect particles to use

### Sentence Structure

### Clues and Considerations
- try and provide a non-nested bulleted list
- talk about vocabulary but try ot leave out the japanese words because the student can refer to the vocabulary table

## Examples

Here are examples of user input and assistant output, pay attention to the score because and why example is scored the way it is.

<example>
  <user:input>
    Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?
  </user:input>
  <score>4</score>
  <score_reasons>
	-BAD: in the vocabulary table it did not show japanese characters, the cells are just blank
	- BAD: the beginner sentence is unnecessary, should just start showing the vocabulary table
	- BAD: In the clues we should not provide the polite form of verbs, because the student needs to figure that out
	- BAD: The sentence structure says too much we really want something that is conceptual like this: [Location][Subject][Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

Let's work through this together.
Here's a table of vocabulary that might help:
|Japanese	| Romaji	| English |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
|			| kuma	 	| bear    | 
|			| doa		| door	  |
|			| gomi		| garbage |
|			| suteru	| to throw away |
|			| dasu		| to put out    |

Possible sentence structure: (Topic)(Location)(Subject)(Verb)
For the first part of the sentence "Bears are at the door", think about how to express "bears" as the topic, "door" as the location, and "to be" as the verb.
For the second part "did you leave the garbage out?", consider how to express "garbage" as the object, "to put out" as the verb, and "you" as the subject.
What do you think is the next step? Do you want to try writing the sentence in Japanese or would you like more clues?
